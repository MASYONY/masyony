## Hi there. I'm MASYONY (Fabian G.)
*Reduce complexity. Automate the rest.*<br />
*Complex systems don’t need more features — they need fewer obstacles.*

Backend & Platform Engineer based in Germany.

I build and operate systems that must work reliably under real-world conditions.  
My focus is on designing tooling and infrastructure that reduce operational complexity and solve practical problems.

## Core Focus

- platform & backend architecture  
- workflow automation & process orchestration  
- secure service communication & system integration  
- cloud-native & self-hosted infrastructure  
- real-time and telephony-based systems  

---

## Technology

**Languages**
- Go
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- SQL

**Platform & Infrastructure**
- Node.js services & API design
- WebSockets & real-time communication
- authentication & licensing infrastructures
- SIP & telephony integrations
- Linux server environments
- Docker & containerized workloads
- Proxmox virtualization
- Kubernetes & Rancher orchestration

**Data**
- MySQL / MariaDB
- MongoDB
- PocketBase

**Testing & Reliability**
- Playwright
- integration & end-to-end testing
- production-oriented validation workflows

## Selected Work

### octane-collection-tool
Open-source cross-platform Go CLI for converting and transmitting test results to OpenText ALM Octane.

- parses JUnit XML
- generates Octane-compatible `<test_result>` files
- uploads results with metadata & tagging
- validates result processing & status

---

### Modular Job Runner
A modular execution service for automating provisioning, deployments, billing workflows, and operational processes.

**Architecture highlights**

- YAML-defined jobs for transparency & reproducibility  
- modular executors (Shell, Docker, extensible)  
- daemon-based queue processing & scheduling  
- artifact & log management  
- callback-driven status reporting  
- API-first integration into existing systems  

Designed to decouple job orchestration from execution and avoid monolithic control systems.

---

### Workflow Automation Platform
Design and implementation of a modular automation layer enabling orchestration of provisioning, deployment, and operational workflows across heterogeneous environments.

---

### Proxmox VNC Proxy
Secure browser-based VNC access layer for virtual machines hosted in Proxmox clusters.

---

### Realtime Voice & Telephony Tooling
Development of SIP-based calling workflows and audio processing pipelines for automated communication scenarios.

---

### Licensing & Authentication Infrastructure
Encrypted WebSocket-based client authentication and license validation system built for secure distribution and control of software clients.

## Engineering Principles

- build tools that solve real operational problems  
- reduce complexity through automation & clear system boundaries  
- design for observability, reliability, and maintainability  
- prefer modular systems over monolithic control layers  

---

## Interests

- cloud-native platforms & orchestration  
- infrastructure automation & self-hosting  
- scalable backend & platform architecture  
- developer tooling ecosystems  
- real-time communication systems
