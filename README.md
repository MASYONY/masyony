## Hi there. I'm MASYONY (Fabian G.)
*Reduce complexity. Automate the rest.*<br />
*Complex systems don’t need more features — they need fewer obstacles.*

Backend & Platform Engineer based in Germany.

I build and operate systems that must work reliably under real-world conditions.  
My focus is on designing tooling and infrastructure that reduce operational complexity and solve practical problems.
